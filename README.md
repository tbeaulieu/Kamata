# Kamata
 Another Ridge Racer 6 based dashboard for the GAWR dash. I've been holding off on this one for a while trying to make it correct. There is a gauge peak functionality that will engage once you start driving, and will display when you are completely stopped (0 MPH/KMH), and your seatbelt is disconnected. You'll see the speed start scrolling when the peak is shown.

This repo contains a modified font (I redesigned it to be monospace) as downloaded from here: https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html, here's the license for it: https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG/blob/master/DSEG-LICENSE.txt

It also contains another font that I developed; BoostedRegular.ttf. All risks are on you upon using it. Distribute it freely but please remember/note who made it :)

# Installation notes:

1) Obtain the GARW dash installer here: https://github.com/dustinsterk/GARWDashUploader
2) You will need to unzip the downloaded dashboard file, rename the folder to "Kamata_Main" (Don't use the quotes), and recompress it. (I know, it's a pain)
3) Upload the dash via the uploader while connected to the GAWR Wifi.
4) Follow the rest of the aforementioned instructions.

There are some prebuilt releases for the uploader, check with the Discord Channel here: https://discord.gg/bmKFrt8XP6
