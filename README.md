# Kamata
 Another Ridge Racer 6 based dashboard for the GAWR dash. I've been holding off on this one for a while trying to make it correct. There is a gauge peak functionality that will engage once you start driving, and will display when you are completely stopped, and your seatbelt is disconnected.

This repo contains a modified font (I redesigned it to be monospace) as downloaded from here: https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html, here's the license for it: https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG/blob/master/DSEG-LICENSE.txt

It also contains another font that I developed; BoostedRegular.ttf. All risks are on you upon using it. Distribute it freely but please remember/note who made it :)
